== DESCRIPTION ==
This is a very simple plugin to add a list of your upcoming events in your WordPress blog. 

Besides the default title and description it only contains event date, event time and event location. So no event categories or event tags. That's it.

Use shortcode [vsel] to display your upcoming events on a page.

= CREDITS =
Without the WordPress codex and help from the WordPress community I was not able to develop this plugin, so: thank you!

I used this tutorial for developing the Very Simple Event List plugin:

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= How can I change date format in US format? =
Very Simple Event List plugin uses the European date format in frontend and backend (day/month/year).
You can change this for frontend in file 'vsel_shortcode.php' by changing 'j F Y' into 'Y F j' (year/month/day).

= Other question or comment? =
Please open a topic in plugin forum or send me a message via my website.
